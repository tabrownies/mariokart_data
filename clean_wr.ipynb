    "# Mario Kart 8 Deluxe World Record Pandas Dataframe Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is a [best selling video game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_video_games#List) for the [Nintendo Switch video game console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch). It is a car racing game with over 100 different race tracks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The website [mkwrs.com](https://mkwrs.com/mk8dx/) contains a list of the world records for each of the video games tracks. This code translates the HTML table from the website into a Pandas dataframe containing all the information about each world record. Each entry in the dataframe contains the following information (listed in order of columns).\n",
    " - track: The name of the race track\n",
    " - cc: The speed of the cart in the record. There are two options: 150cc and 200cc. 200cc is faster than 150cc.\n",
    " - time: The time of the world record.\n",
    " - player: The player owning the record.\n",
    " - nation: The nationality of the record holder\n",
    " - date: The date the record was set\n",
    " - duration\n",
    " - character: What character was used. It should be noted that the combination of character, vehicle, tires, and glider determine the stats of the kart used to set the record.\n",
    " - vehicle: What vehicle was used.\n",
    " - tires: What tires were used.\n",
    " - glider: What glider was used.\n",
    " - splits: The splittimes for each lap.\n",
    " - mushroom: How many mushrooms are used on each lap. At the beginning of the race the player is provided 3 mushrooms which can be used at any time to provide a temporary speed boost.\n",
    " - coin: How many coins were gathered during each lap. The more coins a player has the faster their kart's top speed is. A maximum of 10 coins can be collected.\n",
    " - hybrid_used: Denotes whether hybrid controls were used. On some tracks it is advantageous to pause the game and switch controllers. This denotes if that occurred."
